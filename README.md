# ðŸ§© Java Object-Oriented Shapes Project

This project demonstrates core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java through a modular system of geometric shapes. It includes interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism, and file I/O â€” all wrapped in a clean, testable structure. Originally built as a college assignment, it now serves as a strong portfolio piece for showcasing Java fundamentals.


##  Features

-  Interface implementation (`Drawable`)
-  Abstract classes for shape hierarchy
-  Polymorphic behavior across 2D and 3D shapes
-  File input/output with `input.txt` and `output.txt`
-  Unit testing with `DrawableTest` and `FileTest`
-  Maven support via `pom.xml`

## Technologies Used

- Java 8+
- Maven (for build and dependency management)
- JUnit (for testing)
